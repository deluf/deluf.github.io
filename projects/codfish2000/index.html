        <span class="subtitle-low-margin">About</span>    

        <span class="limit margin">
            Codfish 2000 is a javascript chess engine:                
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The name <i>'Codfish'</i> is inspired by the famous chess engine 
                    <a target="_blank" href="https://stockfishchess.org/">stockfish</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                    The <i>'2000'</i> is the approximate rating
                </li>
            </ul>
        </span>
    
        <span class="limit justify margin">
            For the first few moves, the engine will randomly choose one of the 3 most popular lines played by grandmasters
            in over the board games. If the user plays an unknown opening move or the opening book ends, then the engine will
            start playing moves by itself, using a basic <a target="_blank" href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax">minimax algorithm</a>
            with <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha%E2%80%93beta_pruning">alpha-beta pruning</a> optimization
        </span>
                    
        <span class="limit justify margin">
            All the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rules_of_chess">rules of chess</a> are imlpemented except
            for the repetition rule (if the same board appears three times then the game ends in a draw), 
            the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_notation_(chess)">algebraic notation</a>
            used (the standard method for describing moves) is also slightly simplified and does not consider checks (+) and checkmates (#).
        </span>
        
        <span class="limit justify margin">
            The website offers the possitiblity to use Codfish 2000 to analyze any chess position,
            specified via the standard <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forsyth%E2%80%93Edwards_Notation">FEN</a>
            notation, and also offers the possitiblity to watch the engine play against itself.
        </span>
        
        <span class="limit justify margin">
            Registered users can save the result of each analysis to a database and can also, during a match against the engine,
            create a bookmark of a particular position to analyze later.
