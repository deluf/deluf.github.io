## About

> **Summary**

{{< space 20 >}}

In this group project we explored the performance and scalability of three approaches to building an inverted index â€” a critical data structure in search engines.

Our work compared:
- A simple Python script for small-scale indexing
- A Hadoop MapReduce implementation, finely tuned with combiner optimization and input format adjustments
- A Spark-based solution leveraging off-the-shelf libraries for fast in-memory processing

We evaluated all implementations on a distributed cluster (courtesy of the University of Pisa) using real-world datasets from [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/) (UTF-8 books), ranging from 500 KB to 5 GB. Despite limited RAM, the Hadoop solution showed performance comparable to Spark when tuned properly, while Python excelled in simplicity and low memory usage for smaller data.

This project offered hands-on experience with big data tools and showcased the trade-offs between simplicity, scalability, and efficiency in cloud-native applications.
