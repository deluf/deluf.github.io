## Highlights

> **Physics**

The physics section begins with an introduction to the **atomic nucleus**, explaining its composition of protons and neutrons, the concepts of atomic number, mass number, and isotopes, distinguishing between stable isotopes and radioactive ones.

It then examines the **forces inside the nucleus**: the repulsive electrostatic force between protons and the strong nuclear force, which binds nucleons (protons + neutrons) together.

Next, it explains **nuclear stability** in terms of binding energy per nucleon: light nuclei tend to undergo fusion, while heavy nuclei tend to undergo fission.

> **Maths**

In this section I derived the **law of radioactive decay**, showing that the number of nuclei decreases exponentially with time, characterized by the decay constant. The law is then studied as a mathematical function, including its limits, asymptotes, derivatives and integrals.

> **Sciences**

In the sciences section, I introduced **methods of absolute and relative dating**, including radiometric dating, dendrochronology, and fossil guides.

Finally, I addressed the environmental and safety issues of radioactive decay, analyzing major **nuclear accidents** such as Fukushima (2011) and Chernobyl (1986), their causes, consequences, and ongoing management of radioactive waste.
