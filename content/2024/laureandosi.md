## See it in action

A **school office operator** selects a major, a date for the graduation session, and writes the IDs of the graduands who applied for that session. Then, for each graduand, the system generates a PDF file with the graduand's grades, some statistics and a projection of the final grade. Optionally, the system can automatically send via email the generated PDF files to the respective graduand.

A system **administrator** can run two types of tests: a fast one and a complete one. The fast one shows a summary of the unit tests executed, while the complete one shows all the details of each test case, including a visual inspection of the generated pdf files
