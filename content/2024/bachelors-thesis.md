## About

There are problems, termed multi-modal, which, by their nature, have more than one optimal solution. For example, when typing a destination in a navigator, that same destination might be reached by multiple different roads with very similar traveling times

In problems of this kind, finding all the solutions that are mathematically optimal is "difficult". Consequently, over the years, several alternative search methods have been proposed, which aim to find approximate solutions in "acceptable" times

In my thesis work, I studied such alternative methods, analyzing the various scientific articles in which they have been proposed and comparing the experimental results obtained
